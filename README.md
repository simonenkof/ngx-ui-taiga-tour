# UI Tour for TaigaUI

`taiga-ui-tour` is a fork of **Isaac Mann's** `ngx-tour` and fork of [ngx-ui-tour](https://github.com/hakimio/ngx-ui-tour) by hakimo. The project of **Isaac Mann's** had to be forked since the original is no longer
maintained.
From the hakimo fork, only the module with TuiHint is left and the tour step options have been updated.
